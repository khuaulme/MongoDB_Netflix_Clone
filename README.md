# MongoDB Netflix Clone

This repository hosts the files used in the MongoDB .Live 2021 Atlas Search Workshop: **Delete Your Search History. Use Atlas Search Instead.**

Giving your users the ability to find exactly what they are looking for in your application is critical for a fantastic user experience. Atlas Search makes that easier than ever. In this hands-on coding lab, we will use the $search operator in the MongoDB aggregation pipeline in an application to build fine-grained searches across text, dates, numerics, and geospatial data. Among the many topics we’ll cover are: 
* Full-Text Search
* Fuzzy Matching
* Built-In Scoring 
* Faceted Search 
* Highlighting
* Autocomplete 

And along the way, we’ll discuss performance tips and caveats that you should keep in mind as you build out your searches. From finding your favorite movie to finding your favorite restaurant, look no further!

In this workshop, we will take a very basic app showing only a search bar, and we will build up a full movie search engine Netflix clone.
