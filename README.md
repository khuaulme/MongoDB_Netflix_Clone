# MongoDB Netflix Clone

Giving your users the ability to find exactly what they are looking for in your application is critical for a fantastic user experience. Atlas Search makes that easier than ever. In this hands-on coding lab, we will use the $search operator in the MongoDB aggregation pipeline in an application to build fine-grained searches across text, dates, numerics, and geospatial data. Among the many topics we’ll cover are: 
*  Full-Text Search
* Fuzzy Matching
* Built-In Scoring 
* Faceted Search 
* Highlighting
* Autocomplete 
* And along the way, we’ll discuss performance tips and caveats that you should keep in mind as you build out your searches. From finding your favorite movie to finding your favorite restaurant, look no further!
